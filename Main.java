/* Challenge: You are given an array of integers. Return the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array. The array may contain duplicate entries.

Example: The input [3, 4, -1, 1] should return 2 because it is the smallest positive integer that doesn't exist in the array.

Stretch goal: Your solution should run in linear time and use constant space. */

I see your notes but not as a separate branch 

Darn!
